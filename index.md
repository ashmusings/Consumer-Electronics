## What’s the problem?

###### There is no ‘given’ problem to solve with this study but to come up with not so straightforward insights which we will get by applying excellent methodologies in analytics. The consumer electronics market was USD 14 billion in 2015, has a 5 year CAGR of 18% and is expected to be USD 29 billion by 2020. Urban markets accounts for the major share of 65% of total revenues in the consumer durables sector in India. Demand in urban markets include LED TVs, laptops, split ACs. In rural markets, durables like refrigerators as well as consumer electronic goods are likely to witness more demand. In order to sustain in the competitive environment, market players are offering low cost consumer electronics products in price sensitive regions such as Asia Pacific and Middle East Asia which is why analytics plays an important role in this industry. In the current age of Ecommerce, it becomes critically important to understand how the in-store performances & Sales can be improved by choosing the right data points since there’s still a significant local demand.
